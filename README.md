#Snake Game
A classic Snake Game implementation in Java using Swing and AWT.

Description
This project showcases a simple yet functional Snake Game built in Java. It utilizes Java's graphical libraries such as Swing and AWT for the game's interface.

Features
Simple and intuitive controls using arrow keys.
Collision detection for walls and snake body segments.
Dynamic food placement after consumption.
